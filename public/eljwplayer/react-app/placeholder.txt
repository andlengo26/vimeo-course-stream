# React App Directory

This directory will contain the built React application files.

To build and copy the React app:
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Copy contents of `dist-moodle/` to this directory
3. Ensure the main JS file is accessible as `assets/index.js`

The Moodle plugin will load the React app from:
`./react-app/assets/index.js`
